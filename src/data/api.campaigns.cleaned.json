The adapted content should inspire a sense of travel and teach audiences how to capture and highlight natural beauty through simple and accessible workflows in Lightroom.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nIn FY22, about 35% of CCPP Sustained Base users were dormant and did not meet the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lr Desktop represents 15% of CCPP Desktop MAU, Lr Desktop engagement Monthly 1+ engagement performance has grown YoY in FY22 and FY23 and contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance.\n\nLess than 1/3 of Lr Desktop users have used LrM in the past 28 days. Many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to in their plan.\n\nWith its large MAU, LrM is a proven driver for our CCPP engagement KPIs. There is an opportunity to continue driving mobile discovery and adoption for the paid desktop audience.",

    "overview": "The Japanese version of this phase is the next iteration of the PS brand campaign. Phase 1 focused on versioning acquisition content for E&R to ensure a quick full funnel delivery. Phase 1.5 will be tailored to the E&R experience. This includes leading with use-case/output forward content & copy to help the user understand how Ps applies to them. Leading them to the in product Discover Panel to follow along with the tutorial and step-by-step instructions with a practice file. In the tutorial workflow we want our users to understand the fundamentals and how to apply these skillsets to accomplish their goals.\n\nWith this approach, we believe that if we can accomplish the following:\n\n1) Inspire/motivate users to overcome the lack of need by showcasing how they can easily bring their creative vision to life\n\n2) Effectively teach use-cases with a consistent set of features/workflows to overcome product complexity\n\n3) Reduce time required to accomplish use case with aligned in product learning experiences",

    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nQ3 will be focused on an “Accountant” use case where they need to get an agreement over to their client quickly as they’re ready and available to sign. The TOFU assets bring this use case to life through a relatable, human situation where the Accountant quickly springs into action to get what they need to done for their new client/work, as well as handle what they need to with their anxious puppy.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. As an example, in the Puppy’s Gotta Go story you quickly see the accountant use multiple tools (Webforms; Edit; Request e-signature) to get what’s needed done. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Webforms: Acrobat makes it easy to collect information and apply that data to an existing templated project proposal to make onboarding a new client simple and easy.\n\nMessage # 2/ Request e-signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

The adapted content should inspire a sense of travel and teach audiences how to capture and highlight natural beauty through simple and accessible workflows in Lightroom.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nIn FY22, about 35% of CCPP Sustained Base users were dormant and did not meet the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lr Desktop represents 15% of CCPP Desktop MAU, Lr Desktop engagement Monthly 1+ engagement performance has grown YoY in FY22 and FY23 and contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance.\n\nLess than 1/3 of Lr Desktop users have used LrM in the past 28 days. Many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to in their plan.\n\nWith its large MAU, LrM is a proven driver for our CCPP engagement KPIs. There is an opportunity to continue driving mobile discovery and adoption for the paid desktop audience.",

The adapted content should inspire a sense of travel and teach audiences how to capture and highlight natural beauty through simple and accessible workflows in Lightroom.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nIn FY22, about 35% of CCPP Sustained Base users were dormant and did not meet the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lr Desktop represents 15% of CCPP Desktop MAU, Lr Desktop engagement Monthly 1+ engagement performance has grown YoY in FY22 and FY23 and contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance.\n\nLess than 1/3 of Lr Desktop users have used LrM in the past 28 days. Many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to in their plan.\n\nWith its large MAU, LrM is a proven driver for our CCPP engagement KPIs. There is an opportunity to continue driving mobile discovery and adoption for the paid desktop audience.",

To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product.

    "objective": "**E&R Audiences:**\n\n- They’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\n- While close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\n- They’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\n  - While they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\n- As such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\n**How to Reach the E&R Audience:**\n\n- Show them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\n- If they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\n**What we want the E&R Audience to Feel:**\n\n- We want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\n- Provide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\n- That feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\n  - We’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\n- And ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment",

    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nQ2 will be focused on an “Accountant” use case where they need to get an agreement over to their client quickly as they’re ready and available to sign. The TOFU assets bring this use case to life through a relatable, human situation where the Accountant quickly springs into action to get what they need to done for their new client/work, as well as handle what they need to with their anxious puppy.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets for Try/Buy is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. As an example, in the Puppy’s Gotta Go story you quickly see the accountant use multiple tools (Webforms; Edit; Request e-signature) to get what’s needed done. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Webforms: Acrobat makes it easy to collect information and apply that data to an existing templated project proposal to make onboarding a new client simple and easy.\n\nMessage # 2/ Request e-signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

The adapted content should inspire a sense of travel and teach audiences how to capture and highlight natural beauty through simple and accessible workflows in Lightroom.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nIn FY22, about 35% of CCPP Sustained Base users were dormant and did not meet the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lr Desktop represents 15% of CCPP Desktop MAU, Lr Desktop engagement Monthly 1+ engagement performance has grown YoY in FY22 and FY23 and contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance.\n\nLess than 1/3 of Lr Desktop users have used LrM in the past 28 days. Many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to in their plan.\n\nWith its large MAU, LrM is a proven driver for our CCPP engagement KPIs. There is an opportunity to continue driving mobile discovery and adoption for the paid desktop audience.\n\nBelow is the hero video for the campaign that will be featured on the main landing page:\n\n#### Campaign Hero Video\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.",

    "objective": "**E&R Audiences:**\n\n- They’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\n- While close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\n- They’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\n  - While they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\n- As such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\n**How to Reach the E&R Audience:**\n\n- Show them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\n- If they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\n**What we want the E&R Audience to Feel:**\n\n- We want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\n- Provide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\n- That feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\n  - We’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\n- And ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment",

    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nQ3 will be focused on an “Accountant” use case where they need to get an agreement over to their client quickly as they’re ready and available to sign. The TOFU assets bring this use case to life through a relatable, human situation where the Accountant quickly springs into action to get what they need to done for their new client/work, as well as handle what they need to with their anxious puppy.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. As an example, in the Puppy’s Gotta Go story you quickly see the accountant use multiple tools (Webforms; Edit; Request e-signature) to get what’s needed done. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Webforms: Acrobat makes it easy to collect information and apply that data to an existing templated project proposal to make onboarding a new client simple and easy.\n\nMessage # 2/ Request e-signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

    "objective": "**E&R Audiences:**\n\n- They’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\n- While close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\n- They’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\n  - While they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\n- As such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\n**How to Reach the E&R Audience:**\n\n- Show them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\n- If they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\n**What we want the E&R Audience to Feel:**\n\n- We want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\n- Provide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\n- That feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\n  - We’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\n- And ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment",

In the tutorial workflow we want our users to understand the fundamentals and how to apply these skillsets to accomplish their goals.\n\nWith this approach, we believe that if we can accomplish the following:\n\n1) Inspire/motivate users to overcome the lack of need by showcasing how they can easily bring their creative vision to life\n\n2) Effectively teach use-cases with a consistent set of features/workflows to overcome product complexity\n\n3) Reduce time required to accomplish use case with aligned in product learning experiences",

    "objective": "**E&R Audiences:**\n\n- They’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\n- While close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\n- They’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\n  - While they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\n- As such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\n**How to Reach the E&R Audience:**\n\n- Show them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\n- If they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\n**What we want the E&R Audience to Feel:**\n\n- We want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\n- Provide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\n- That feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\n  - We’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\n- And ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment",
    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nQ2 will be focused on an “Accountant” use case where they need to get an agreement over to their client quickly as they’re ready and available to sign. The TOFU assets bring this use case to life through a relatable, human situation where the Accountant quickly springs into action to get what they need to done for their new client/work, as well as handle what they need to with their anxious puppy.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets for Try/Buy is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. As an example, in the Puppy’s Gotta Go story you quickly see the accountant use multiple tools (Webforms; Edit; Request e-signature) to get what’s needed done. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Webforms: Acrobat makes it easy to collect information and apply that data to an existing templated project proposal to make onboarding a new client simple and easy.\n\nMessage # 2/ Request e-signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

The user doesn't have the need to go back to the Discover article as the deeplink opens up the article content along with free asset in-app.\n\nBecause\n\nCopy to Files is not easy to follow for users. Dead ends if the user doesn't understand.\n\nUsers needs to be signed-in to perform the action.\n\nHardly any way for us to measure if the user actually got back to open/use the file.\n\nNot in scope:\n\nAdd Library workflows\n\nLightroom presets deeplinks\n\nRelease Plan:\n\nWe will release this as an A/B test. Details on the Requirements tab.\n\nSuccess metrics:\n\nPrimary - Product engagement (% of cohort users who end up on premiere pro in the next 24 hrs)\n\nSecondary - article engagement on mobile.\n\nCampaign routes:\n\nSocial\n\nDisplay ads\n\nAs we target the mobile users specifically.",

    "overview": "Latin American Spanish version of US YSYS Pet Photography. YSYS Pets is a campaign that will run in EMEA in Q2 for the Acquisition audience.\n\nThis is a full-funnel campaign that will drive trial, purchase and repeat use of our photography products by building out inspirational and educational content for prospects and customers.\n\nThis campaign will focus on a new use case: Pet Photography. The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more photos of their pets and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nOn average, 35% of CCPP users in the sustained base are dormant and not meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Within the Lightroom Desktop sustained base audience, only 12.5% of users are meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance and is the recommended product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey\n\nOnly 39.2% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nObjective & KPI:\n\nObjective: Inspire prospects and current users to try Lightroom through approachable content about Pet photography\n\nPrimary KPI: Drive Monthly 1+ Use for Lr Desktop and Lr Mobile users by teaching the basic foundations of photography for a beginner with limited skills (Minimum Use).\n\nSecondary KPI: Drive Monthly Average Use for Lr Desktop/Lr Mobile Users by encouraging the user to engage with another surface and the product more (Depth of Use).\n\nWhile this campaign has been leveraged from EMEA and leans very pro, the objective is to minimize the amount of intimidating equipment (SLRs, big lenses, lighting equipment) to make this accessible to everyone, regardless of skill level.",

The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more photos that showcase the light of the subject matter and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows.\n\nEngagement and Retention:\n\nOn average, 36% of CCPP users in the sustained base are dormant and do not meet the Monthly 1+ KPI. Within the Lightroom Desktop sustained base audience, only 12.5% of users are meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance and is the “recommended for photo editing” product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey. Lightroom Desktop KPI performance is a critical component of our New User KPI performance.\n\nAbout 30% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nAs of Q2 2022, Both Lightroom Desktop and Mobile engagement for Monthly 1+ has exceeded YoY performance consistently every week – major product updates (June release, MAX) and tentpole campaigns like YSYS are critical to the continued strength and performance of Lr engagement for the sustained base.\n\n#### Campaign Hero Video\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.",

Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment",

Being able to get things done easily and eﬀiciently is important.\n- They need document solutions for their business and are willing to pay for tools; especially if it gives them more time back to focus on their business. But many have developed their own patchwork systems, and while inefficient, inertia is a barrier to change.\n- 52% say improving productivity and efficiency is their greatest challenge in the next 12 months\n- 39% say managing data and document files is a top business need\n\n**Acquisition Audiences:**\n\n- Prospective paying customers- it’s possible they are already using the free product but it doesn’t have all the premium features they would need for their business\n- Micro-entrepreneurs (1-9 employees), working professionals working at a small company (less than 100 employees), freelancers\n\n**How to Reach the Acquisition Audience:**\n\n- Message/show how an Acrobat tool can help for any practically document/business challenge\n\n**What we want the Acquisition Audience to Feel:**\n\n- Relieved that Acrobat saves them time, and simplifies their workflows\n- “oh wait, I can do that with Acrobat?!”\n- We want audiences to see the value in purchasing the subscription by offering a free 7-day trial",

    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nQ2 will be focused on an “Accountant” use case where they need to get an agreement over to their client quickly as they’re ready and available to sign. The TOFU assets bring this use case to life through a relatable, human situation where the Accountant quickly springs into action to get what they need to done for their new client/work, as well as handle what they need to with their anxious puppy.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets for Try/Buy is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. As an example, in the Puppy’s Gotta Go story you quickly see the accountant use multiple tools (Webforms; Edit; Request e-signature) to get what’s needed done. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Webforms: Acrobat makes it easy to collect information and apply that data to an existing templated project proposal to make onboarding a new client simple and easy.\n\nMessage # 2/ Request e-signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

YSYS Pets is a campaign that will run in EMEA in Q2 for the Acquisition audience.\n\nThis is a full-funnel campaign that will drive trial, purchase and repeat use of our photography products by building out inspirational and educational content for prospects and customers.\n\nThis campaign will focus on a new use case: Pet Photography. The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more photos of their pets and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nOn average, 35% of CCPP users in the sustained base are dormant and not meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Within the Lightroom Desktop sustained base audience, only 12.5% of users are meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance and is the recommended product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey\n\nOnly 39.2% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nObjective & KPI:\n\nObjective: Inspire prospects and current users to try Lightroom through approachable content about Pet photography\n\nPrimary KPI: Drive Monthly 1+ Use for Lr Desktop and Lr Mobile users by teaching the basic foundations of photography for a beginner with limited skills (Minimum Use).\n\nSecondary KPI: Drive Monthly Average Use for Lr Desktop/Lr Mobile Users by encouraging the user to engage with another surface and the product more (Depth of Use).\n\nWhile this campaign has been leveraged from EMEA and leans very pro, the objective is to minimize the amount of intimidating equipment (SLRs, big lenses, lighting equipment) to make this accessible to everyone, regardless of skill level.",

The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more photos that showcase the light of the subject matter and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows.\n\nEngagement and Retention:\n\nOn average, 36% of CCPP users in the sustained base are dormant and do not meet the Monthly 1+ KPI. Within the Lightroom Desktop sustained base audience, only 12.5% of users are meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance and is the “recommended for photo editing” product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey. Lightroom Desktop KPI performance is a critical component of our New User KPI performance.\n\nAbout 30% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nAs of Q2 2022, Both Lightroom Desktop and Mobile engagement for Monthly 1+ has exceeded YoY performance consistently every week – major product updates (June release, MAX) and tentpole campaigns like YSYS are critical to the continued strength and performance of Lr engagement for the sustained base.\n\n#### Campaign Hero Video\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.",

    "objective": "**E&R Audiences:**\n\n- They’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\n- While close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\n- They’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\n  - While they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\n- As such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\n**How to Reach the E&R Audience:**\n\n- Show them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\n- If they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\n**What we want the E&R Audience to Feel:**\n\n- We want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\n- Provide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\n- That feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\n  - We’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\n- And ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment",

    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nQ2 will be focused on an “Accountant” use case where they need to get an agreement over to their client quickly as they’re ready and available to sign. The TOFU assets bring this use case to life through a relatable, human situation where the Accountant quickly springs into action to get what they need to done for their new client/work, as well as handle what they need to with their anxious puppy.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets for Try/Buy is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. As an example, in the Puppy’s Gotta Go story you quickly see the accountant use multiple tools (Webforms; Edit; Request e-signature) to get what’s needed done. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Webforms: Acrobat makes it easy to collect information and apply that data to an existing templated project proposal to make onboarding a new client simple and easy.\n\nMessage # 2/ Request e-signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

The back-end data is showing the CTR as 0.09% which is exceeding our benchmark of 0.05%. To validate what we're seeing, we'd like to test running Happy Kelly Display going into its 4th month versus creative that hasn't been shown in a while.\n\nGoal: Learn if creative fatigue has kicked in to determine how long we should run display campaigns that are performing well.\n\nWhat else would we like to learn?\n\n\\- How does longer-running content perform against content we haven't shown in a while from a CTR perspective?\n\n\\- How doe CPSAU efficiency compare to an existing campaign versus running a newer campaign leveraging past content?",

    "overview": "Korean version of US YSYS Pet Photography. YSYS Pets is a campaign that will run in EMEA in Q2 for the Acquisition audience.\n\nThis is a full-funnel campaign that will drive trial, purchase and repeat use of our photography products by building out inspirational and educational content for prospects and customers.\n\nThis campaign will focus on a new use case: Pet Photography. The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more photos of their pets and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nOn average, 35% of CCPP users in the sustained base are dormant and not meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Within the Lightroom Desktop sustained base audience, only 12.5% of users are meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance and is the recommended product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey\n\nOnly 39.2% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nObjective & KPI:\n\nObjective: Inspire prospects and current users to try Lightroom through approachable content about Pet photography\n\nPrimary KPI: Drive Monthly 1+ Use for Lr Desktop and Lr Mobile users by teaching the basic foundations of photography for a beginner with limited skills (Minimum Use).\n\nSecondary KPI: Drive Monthly Average Use for Lr Desktop/Lr Mobile Users by encouraging the user to engage with another surface and the product more (Depth of Use).\n\nWhile this campaign has been leveraged from EMEA and leans very pro, the objective is to minimize the amount of intimidating equipment (SLRs, big lenses, lighting equipment) to make this accessible to everyone, regardless of skill level.",

    "overview": "Japanese version of US YSYS Pet Photography. YSYS Pets is a campaign that will run in EMEA in Q2 for the Acquisition audience.\n\nThis is a full-funnel campaign that will drive trial, purchase and repeat use of our photography products by building out inspirational and educational content for prospects and customers.\n\nThis campaign will focus on a new use case: Pet Photography. The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more photos of their pets and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nOn average, 35% of CCPP users in the sustained base are dormant and not meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Within the Lightroom Desktop sustained base audience, only 12.5% of users are meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance and is the recommended product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey\n\nOnly 39.2% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nObjective & KPI:\n\nObjective: Inspire prospects and current users to try Lightroom through approachable content about Pet photography\n\nPrimary KPI: Drive Monthly 1+ Use for Lr Desktop and Lr Mobile users by teaching the basic foundations of photography for a beginner with limited skills (Minimum Use).\n\nSecondary KPI: Drive Monthly Average Use for Lr Desktop/Lr Mobile Users by encouraging the user to engage with another surface and the product more (Depth of Use).\n\nWhile this campaign has been leveraged from EMEA and leans very pro, the objective is to minimize the amount of intimidating equipment (SLRs, big lenses, lighting equipment) to make this accessible to everyone, regardless of skill level.",

They do however have common denominators that this campaign is built upon:\n\n5/10 members currently perceive the value of their membership to be lower than the price.\n\nPrice is the #1 attrition reason.\n\nMembers trust peers first, influencers second and brands third.\n\nTo increase value perception (and price elasticity) we have identified 3 value pillars that research show can increase value perception and willingness to retain – Learn & Guidance is the first and most important of those pillars. Members who associate Adobe with Learn & Guidance have a 20pp higher willingness to retain vs. the average members and are more active users. The challenge we are here to solve is that only 11% of our members make the association between Adobe & Learn. We need to increase awareness of our learn offering, and with that drive active use among members.\n\nLearn & Guidance includes tutorials, live sessions, training courses, contextual help as well as building domain knowledge.",

Moving a member from Inactive (0 or 1 day of activity in the last 28 days) to Active (2+ days of activity in the last 28 days) decreases cancel attempts by 4% and every member that we can move from inactive to active is worth $10 in ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue).",

Members who associate Adobe with Learn & Guidance have a 20pp higher willingness to retain vs. the average members and are more active users. The challenge we are here to solve is that only 11% of our members make the association between Adobe & Learn. We need to increase awareness of our learn offering, and with that drive active use among members.\n\nLearn & Guidance includes tutorials, live sessions, training courses, contextual help as well as building domain knowledge.",

The campaign's purpose is to lift members from inactive to active status. 80% of our members express a desire to become more active, but current resurrection marketing strategy and tactics only resurrects approximately 25% of the members each quarter. The focus of this campaign is on the photography audience as it is the largest group - making up nearly 50% of the total audience size.\n\nThe goal of the campaign will be to increase the number of members lifted from inactive to active. Moving a member from Inactive (0 or 1 day of activity in the last 28 days) to Active (2+ days of activity in the last 28 days) decreases cancel attempts by 4% and every member that we can move from inactive to active is worth $10 in ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue).",

The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more self-portraits and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows\n\nBusiness/Marketing Context:\n\nAcquisition:\n\nTraffic soft in Q1 but trended up later in quarter, driven by natural (-39% YoY, -7% QoQ) and paid search (-16% YoY, -2% QoQ) declines.\n\nYSYS Campaign is making up for decline in organic traffic with sustained quarterly investment in Display, Video and Social paid media.\n\nCustomer feedback on YSYS marketing assets and campaign landing page: Lightroom can produce artistic and high quality photos, but perception is that it is for professional photographers. This perception is driven by the equipment and workflows we have showcased in past content. Full research deck here.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nOn average, 49% of CCPP users in the sustained base are not engaging and meeting the Monthly 2+ Days KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP Monthly 2+ Days KPI performance and is the recommended product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey\n\nOnly 39.2% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nLightroom Mobile is the most used mobile app in CCPP and is critical to our Mobile 1+ KPI performance, contributing an average of 79% of Mobile MAU for this KPI\n\nObjective & KPI:\n\nObjective: Inspire prospects and users to try Lightroom through approachable content about self-portraits and selfies.\n\nPrimary KPI: Drive Monthly 1+ Use for Lr Desktop and Lr Mobile users by teaching the basic foundations of photography for a beginner with limited skills\n\nSecondary KPI: Drive Monthly Average Use for CCPP Lr Desktop/Lr Mobile Users by encouraging the user to engage with the product more\n\nNote: Engagement KPIs are being updated on Q2 2022 – all KPIs are now inclusive of entire ecosystem: desktop, mobile and web\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nPhoto hobbyist prospects and beginner/inactive Lr users",

The creative and messaging in the campaign need to help our users overcome key barriers for prospects and customers:\n\n- Perception that Lightroom is for professional photographers\n- Lack of confidence\n- Lack of time & motivation\n\n- Creative and messaging to overcome the key barriers could revolve around the following:\n\n- Featuring talent and equipment that feels approachable to users.\n- Showcasing smart/hidden product features / workflows that help overcome time and skill constraints.\n- Highlight intuitive workflows that meet users where they are so they can be successful\n\n**Feedback from users:**\n\n- Feedback from beginner prospects:\n\n- Content conveys that you can make “artistic”, “high quality” and “professional edits” (top mentions)\n- Nearly all prospects interviewed felt the intent for the ad and product is for professional photographers.\n- Elements that led to professional perception:\n\n- Presence of DSLR/mirrorless cameras\n- Survey participants reported mainly using smartphone to capture\n- Color grading feature looks advanced/technical\n- Adobe brand perception\n\n- Feedback from new Lightroom users:\n\n- _“For a mom user, it’s a little over functional. The permutations of choices across the bottom and then the choice under each one… are too many.” -Shahana_\n- _“This is definitely a heavy technical app. It’s not like a laymen photo editing app compared to other things I use.” – Anna_\n- _“It’s hard to get the expectation you have in your head to your computer…learning lightroom or photography in general…so many settings…one little change can make it completely diﬀerent…how each little thing can interact with every other thing is challenging…I like to think I am a smart person…it is a little bit harder than I expected it to be…” – Danielle_",

    "overview": "Korean localized version of YSYS Self-Portrait.\n\nOverview:\n\nDrive trial, purchase and repeat use of our photography products by building out inspirational and educational content for prospects and customers.\n\nThis campaign will focus on a new use case: Self Portrait / Selfies. The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more self-portraits and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows\n\nBusiness/Marketing Context:\n\nAcquisition:\n\nTraffic soft in Q1 but trended up later in quarter, driven by natural (-39% YoY, -7% QoQ) and paid search (-16% YoY, -2% QoQ) declines.\n\nYSYS Campaign is making up for decline in organic traffic with sustained quarterly investment in Display, Video and Social paid media.\n\nCustomer feedback on YSYS marketing assets and campaign landing page: Lightroom can produce artistic and high quality photos, but perception is that it is for professional photographers. This perception is driven by the equipment and workflows we have showcased in past content. Full research deck here.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nOn average, 49% of CCPP users in the sustained base are not engaging and meeting the Monthly 2+ Days KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP Monthly 2+ Days KPI performance and is the recommended product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey\n\nOnly 39.2% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nLightroom Mobile is the most used mobile app in CCPP and is critical to our Mobile 1+ KPI performance, contributing an average of 79% of Mobile MAU for this KPI\n\nObjective & KPI:\n\nObjective: Inspire prospects and users to try Lightroom through approachable content about self-portraits and selfies.\n\nPrimary KPI: Drive Monthly 1+ Use for Lr Desktop and Lr Mobile users by teaching the basic foundations of photography for a beginner with limited skills\n\nSecondary KPI: Drive Monthly Average Use for CCPP Lr Desktop/Lr Mobile Users by encouraging the user to engage with the product more\n\nNote: Engagement KPIs are being updated on Q2 2022 – all KPIs are now inclusive of entire ecosystem: desktop, mobile and web\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nPhoto hobbyist prospects and beginner/inactive Lr users",

This material will have a simple deep linking capability so that the user can easily navigate to the Remixing Tab within the Discover Panel. This intuitive navigation is key to the users' engagement as we have seen that discoverability has been an issue based on the data provided. With each exposure, the user is more likely to try Remix. Once a user has successfully navigated to Remix, we will no longer show them campaign materials.",

Members who associate Adobe with Learn & Guidance have a 20pp higher willingness to retain vs. the average members and are more active users. The challenge we are here to solve is that only 11% of our members make the association between Adobe & Learn. We need to increase awareness of our learn offering, and with that drive active use among members.\n\nLearn & Guidance includes tutorials, live sessions, training courses, contextual help as well as building domain knowledge.",

From the discover page tutorials will be hosted in app with a deeplink to open assets.\n\nObjective: Leverage Discover content in CCH to drive CC app engagement via a deeplink to Discover Panel with a free asset in Photoshop.\n\nBusiness Problem: Users often are inspired and empowered through helpful CCH Discover content yet they currently view the content in a web browser, instead of in product where deeper learning and engagement is possible.\n\nUser Problem: CCH Discover content has related sample files that takes multiple steps to configure, and viewing the instructions requires split focus between Photoshop's workspace and CCH on web.\n\nHypothesis: Seamlessly driving users from CCH Discover content to Discover Panel with auto-loaded sample files will accelerate ah-ha moments for users and increase avg monthly active days.",

The permutations of choices across the bottom and then the choice under each one… are too many.” -Shahana_\n- _“This is definitely a heavy technical app. It’s not like a laymen photo editing app compared to other things I use.” – Anna_\n- _“It’s hard to get the expectation you have in your head to your computer…learning lightroom or photography in general…so many settings…one little change can make it completely diﬀerent…how each little thing can interact with every other thing is challenging…I like to think I am a smart person…it is a little bit harder than I expected it to be…” – Danielle_",

The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more self-portraits and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows\n\nBusiness/Marketing Context:\n\nAcquisition:\n\nTraffic soft in Q1 but trended up later in quarter, driven by natural (-39% YoY, -7% QoQ) and paid search (-16% YoY, -2% QoQ) declines.\n\nYSYS Campaign is making up for decline in organic traffic with sustained quarterly investment in Display, Video and Social paid media.\n\nCustomer feedback on YSYS marketing assets and campaign landing page: Lightroom can produce artistic and high quality photos, but perception is that it is for professional photographers. This perception is driven by the equipment and workflows we have showcased in past content. Full research deck here.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nOn average, 49% of CCPP users in the sustained base are not engaging and meeting the Monthly 2+ Days KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP Monthly 2+ Days KPI performance and is the recommended product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey\n\nOnly 39.2% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nLightroom Mobile is the most used mobile app in CCPP and is critical to our Mobile 1+ KPI performance, contributing an average of 79% of Mobile MAU for this KPI\n\nObjective & KPI:\n\nObjective: Inspire prospects and users to try Lightroom through approachable content about self-portraits and selfies.\n\nPrimary KPI: Drive Monthly 1+ Use for Lr Desktop and Lr Mobile users by teaching the basic foundations of photography for a beginner with limited skills\n\nSecondary KPI: Drive Monthly Average Use for CCPP Lr Desktop/Lr Mobile Users by encouraging the user to engage with the product more\n\nNote: Engagement KPIs are being updated on Q2 2022 – all KPIs are now inclusive of entire ecosystem: desktop, mobile and web\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nPhoto hobbyist prospects and beginner/inactive Lr users",

    "overview": "Overview:\n\nThis is a full-funnel campaign that will drive trial, purchase and repeat use of our photography products by building out inspirational and educational content for prospects and customers.\n\nThis campaign will focus on a new use case: Pet Photography. The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more photos of their pets and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nOn average, 35% of CCPP users in the sustained base are dormant and not meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Within the Lightroom Desktop sustained base audience, only 12.5% of users are meeting the Monthly 1+ KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP KPI performance and is the recommended product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey\n\nOnly 39.2% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nObjective & KPI:\n\nObjective: Inspire prospects and current users to try Lightroom through approachable content about Pet photography\n\nPrimary KPI: Drive Monthly 1+ Use for Lr Desktop and Lr Mobile users by teaching the basic foundations of photography for a beginner with limited skills (Minimum Use).\n\nSecondary KPI: Drive Monthly Average Use for Lr Desktop/Lr Mobile Users by encouraging the user to engage with another surface and the product more (Depth of Use).\n\nWhile this campaign has been leveraged from EMEA and leans very pro, the objective is to minimize the amount of intimidating equipment (SLRs, big lenses, lighting equipment) to make this accessible to everyone, regardless of skill level.",

The creative and messaging in the campaign need to help our users overcome key barriers for prospects and customers:\n\n- Perception that Lightroom is for professional photographers\n- Lack of confidence\n- Lack of time & motivation\n\n- Creative and messaging to overcome the key barriers could revolve around the following:\n\n- Featuring talent and equipment that feels approachable to users.\n- Showcasing smart/hidden product features / workflows that help overcome time and skill constraints.\n- Highlight intuitive workflows that meet users where they are so they can be successful\n\n**Feedback from users:**\n\n- Feedback from beginner prospects:\n\n- Content conveys that you can make “artistic”, “high quality” and “professional edits” (top mentions)\n- Nearly all prospects interviewed felt the intent for the ad and product is for professional photographers.\n- Elements that led to professional perception:\n\n- Presence of DSLR/mirrorless cameras\n- Survey participants reported mainly using smartphone to capture\n- Color grading feature looks advanced/technical\n- Adobe brand perception\n\n- Feedback from new Lightroom users:\n\n- _“For a mom user, it’s a little over functional. The permutations of choices across the bottom and then the choice under each one… are too many.” -Shahana_\n- _“This is definitely a heavy technical app. It’s not like a laymen photo editing app compared to other things I use.” – Anna_\n- _“It’s hard to get the expectation you have in your head to your computer…learning lightroom or photography in general…so many settings…one little change can make it completely diﬀerent…how each little thing can interact with every other thing is challenging…I like to think I am a smart person…it is a little bit harder than I expected it to be…” – Danielle_",

    "overview": "Brazilian Portuguese localized version of YSYS Self-Portrait.\n\nOverview:\n\nDrive trial, purchase and repeat use of our photography products by building out inspirational and educational content for prospects and customers.\n\nThis campaign will focus on a new use case: Self Portrait / Selfies. The goal is to inspire prospects and users to take more self-portraits and learn how to edit with simple and accessible workflows\n\nBusiness/Marketing Context:\n\nAcquisition:\n\nTraffic soft in Q1 but trended up later in quarter, driven by natural (-39% YoY, -7% QoQ) and paid search (-16% YoY, -2% QoQ) declines.\n\nYSYS Campaign is making up for decline in organic traffic with sustained quarterly investment in Display, Video and Social paid media.\n\nCustomer feedback on YSYS marketing assets and campaign landing page: Lightroom can produce artistic and high quality photos, but perception is that it is for professional photographers. This perception is driven by the equipment and workflows we have showcased in past content. Full research deck here.\n\nEngagement & Retention:\n\nOn average, 49% of CCPP users in the sustained base are not engaging and meeting the Monthly 2+ Days KPI. Drivers of low engagement are 1) lack of need, 2) too hard to use, and 3) lack of time.\n\nAlthough Lightroom Desktop represents 15% of CCPP MAU, it contributes a larger percentage to the overall CCPP Monthly 2+ Days KPI performance and is the recommended product we encourage new users to download in the App Picker during the New User Journey\n\nOnly 39.2% of Lightroom Desktop users have used Lightroom Mobile in the past 28 days, many paid users are unaware of the mobile apps they are entitled to.\n\nLightroom Mobile is the most used mobile app in CCPP and is critical to our Mobile 1+ KPI performance, contributing an average of 79% of Mobile MAU for this KPI\n\nObjective & KPI:\n\nObjective: Inspire prospects and users to try Lightroom through approachable content about self-portraits and selfies.\n\nPrimary KPI: Drive Monthly 1+ Use for Lr Desktop and Lr Mobile users by teaching the basic foundations of photography for a beginner with limited skills\n\nSecondary KPI: Drive Monthly Average Use for CCPP Lr Desktop/Lr Mobile Users by encouraging the user to engage with the product more\n\nNote: Engagement KPIs are being updated on Q2 2022 – all KPIs are now inclusive of entire ecosystem: desktop, mobile and web\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nPhoto hobbyist prospects and beginner/inactive Lr users",

    "objective": "Adobe has 16M paid customers across the Design, Video, Illustration, Photography and Student audience segments across the globe. Within each of these audiences there is an interest and proficiency spectrum ranging from beginners to experts and Hobbyist to Professionals. Their motivation to create range from strictly internal to personal validation to driving policy change and public opinion. Some of these members have paid for their membership themselves, others have access through work. Some are new as members; others have been members for 10 years. All in all – it is a diverse group.\n\nThe good news – research performed by Bond Loyalty Group in 2020, shows that regardless of how you slice and dice the audience matrix, the same Top 3 value perception drivers win.\n\n**Drivers of Value Perception**\n\n**#1 Learn & Guidance**\n\nOur members want to learn – they seek both domain knowledge and product knowledge to get better at their current craft or learn new skills. Adobe has a breadth of learn resources for them – online seminars, learn courses, quick how-to videos, domain expertise shared by the community and guided tutorials in app.  The challenge/opportunity – only 11% of our members associate Adobe with Learn. But those who do have a 20 percentage points higher willingness to retain and 77% say that they are likely or highly likely to use our learn resources once they are made aware.\n\n**#2 Productivity & Flexibility**\n\nThis pillar is about having the flexibility to work anywhere, on any device as well as removing repetitive tasks and leverage templates to get to the end results quicker. 43% of our members currently associate Adobe with efficiency and those who do, have a 13 percentage point higher willingness to renew their membership. Adobe offers the ability to work seamlessly across platforms, branch out to new apps, AI powered workflows that reduces the time spent on repetitive tasks and of course productivity services like CC Libraries and Collaboration. We also provide templates that help kickstart a creative process for beginners or members in a rush.\n\n**\\# 3 Member Exclusives**\n\nThis pillar is about being rewarded for your loyalty and the total financial value included in the membership. We offer our members several benefits that outside of the membership would come at an additional cost – among them a comprehensive fonts collection and Adobe Portfolio. We also provide free presets from sought after photographers as well as free Photoshop and Illustrator templates.\n\n25% of the respondents in the research use at least one competing service/benefit instead of leveraging the equivalent from Adobe that is included in their membership. 72% of those who do, pay for that service, and learn is the #1 contributor.\n\nIn May, Adobe launched a campaign focused on the first value pillar – Learn & Guidance. We are now asking agency XX to create a campaign for Pillar #3 – Member Exclusives.\n\nMember exclusives can be split in 2 subcategories – Benefits that you get because you are a member & Benefits that you can ONLY get from Adobe.\n\n**Benefits that are exclusive to members only.**\n\nWithin the creative cloud membership, there are several benefits that members likely would pay for outside of their membership if they were not included – **Fonts & Portfolio** are the primary two.\n\nUsers of Adobe Fonts are significantly more likely to renew their membership (71% vs. 63%) and have $160 higher LTV value. Past campaigns have shown that Fonts awareness marketing is able to lift customer engagement with +0.23pt.\n\nPortfolio is showing a slightly smaller positive uplift in likelihood to renew (71% vs. 67%) and have a $100 impact on LTV for All Apps plan members and $37 for Photography Plan Members. Past campaigns have driven 4.98% uplift in customer engagement and +0.08pt uplift in retention for the photography segment while All Apps surprisingly remained flat.\n\nWithin benefits that are exclusive to members, we are also seeing our members value exclusive content – **Photos, Presets, Graphics.** When used as giveaways in campaigns, these types of assets have proven to lift engagement, e.g 5-35% uplift in engagement from offering free presets to our photography audience. Based on this knowledge, several of our engagement & retention campaigns currently use free assets as part of the standard campaign kit. All of them have proven to drive engagement uplift, but none have measured the impact these giveaways have on value perception.\n\nIn terms of member exclusives, Fonts & Portfolio are exclusive to members as you cannot access the functionality before you become a member. For free assets, the story is slightly different. These assets are often offered to both prospects (to drive trial downloads) and members, and therefore not marketed as members only. There is one exception – the photography team launched 6 sets of premium presets in June, where most of the presets are only available to members.\n\nThere are multiple other possible member exclusives that Adobe has not yet tested performance of but that we believe would/could move the needle. Examples includes partner offers and exclusive access to seminars/portfolio reviews with sought after industry professionals.\n\nIn general – to date our focus has been to drive engagement in product vs shift in value perception. Member exclusives have therefore not been set up or communicated as being exclusive to our Creative Cloud members.\n\n**Benefits that only Adobe can provide.**\n\nAs part of their membership strategy, several brands that Bond Loyalty group work with, provide unique opportunities for their members. Adidas design special collections that only members of their loyalty program can buy. Mastercard invites their members behind the scenes of Hamilton in their concept “priceless”, Airbnb hosts overnight experiences at Fenway Park, on the Chinese wall and Abbey Road studios.\n\nIn 2017 Adobe launched Hidden Treasures of Creativity which follows the same structure of providing a unique experience only Adobe can provide. It is an ongoing series about rediscovering, recreating, and preserving the forgotten tools of old masters, and placing those tools in the hands of a new generation of artists in the digital age. We have digitalized the brushes Edvard Munch used to create the Scream and provided them as Photoshop Brushes. We have completed 5 fonts that the Bauhaus masters were in the process of creating when the school was shut down during the world war. To date, we have released 3 editions of Hidden Treasures and we have seen significant PR value, traffic to our landing pages and price per asset download is below the E&R teams’ current cost per marketing driven product launch. But the campaign has not been exclusive to members and there has not been any measurement as to its ability to lift value perception.\n\nWe do however know, that having access to members only opportunities, belonging to an exclusive community, is one of the key differentiators between a subscription that you can turn on and off, and a membership that you value and have emotional belonging and loyalty to.\n\nWhile marketing member exclusives (and non-exclusives) have proven to drive product engagement uplift, we have not seen positive movement on our quarterly general measurement of CC value perception. It is obvious that we have a dual communication challenge. Just raising awareness and driving adoption of our member exclusives will not be enough – we need to do it in a way thatleaves the member with the feeling that these individual pieces are part of a bigger pledge from Adobe to always reward its members for their loyalty.",

Then, she imported into Meta's Spark AR to turn it into an interactive selfie filter for Instagram.\n\nThese sorts of branded selfie filters do REALLY well on IG, and is a marketing tool that Savvy Communicators would want to create themselves. For a Disco story, we would ask Quinn to walk us through this process (but not with an Ultrafragola, which is probably copyrighted).\n\nTL;DR\n\nCreator-focused Ai tutorial. Learn to make a vector by tracing a photo, then give it 3D effects, and (optional) bring it into Spark AR.\n\nInspired by this post:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CaCuX0EM2fN/",

    "objective": "The two big mobile learnings we have are:\n\n- Most Desktop users have not tried mobile apps within their entitlement.\n- Desktop users often have the assumption that there will be feature parity from desktop to mobile. We are not at feature parity yet, so it’s instead important to highlight the occasions of use, which are 1) Capturing the moment and 2) Using downtime productively\n- 85% of Ai SA subscribers have never logged into the Ai on iPad app an 7% have logged on in the past, but not in past 4 weeks\n\nData\n\n- A/B tests have proven that paid media support is effective in driving mobile app engagement. (FY20 campaign drove +8.88% lift in Rush first use, +7.51% lift in Rush repeat use, and a +6.34% lift in 28-day Rush launch rate.)\n- Existing customer cSAT for Ai on iPad is 64%. Not as successful for net new iPad-only customers (cSAT 45%)\n- With currently 3.7% penetration of Ai user base, primary focus is bringing added value to the desktop user who wants to work on mobile.\n\nAi Mobile User Insights:\n\n- Is a CPro (67%) or Aspiring Hobbyists (32%)\n- Use Cases: Illustration (70% of iPad vs 28% desktop) and Business Graphics (55% on iPad and desktop)\n- Competitive Product Usage: 48% use Procreate (~Ps on iPad usage)\n- Skews younger (61% <35 vs 47% <35 desktop), indicating Next Gen Creative\n\nTop Ai on iPad Use Cases\n\n- Drawing Illustrations\n- Create Logos/Icons\n- Lettering/Type\n- Marketing/Ad Content\n- Positive feedback for iPad\n- Impressed with the shape builder tool.\n- Enjoyed saving to the cloud and having access to a laptop.\n- Liked the “short tutorials” because they were more efficient than watching a video\n- Liked the smoothing feature\n- Liked the way fills and gradients worked – being able to drag the points around\n- Able to go back and “tinker” with gradients on existing objects\n- Found new functions such as masks and mirroring\n- iPad app seems easier than desktop",

They can use simple animations to enhance photography and make interactive, dynamic social posts with movement.\n\nPitch: Tween is a function found within the Photoshop Timeline feature that allows you to create simple frame animations by taking a starting frame and end frame and creating the frames in between.\n\nHelpx doc on how to Tween: https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/using/creating\\_a\\_motion\\_tween\\_animation.html\n\nThis article will be a how-to explaining the production of tweens within Photoshop. Possible iterations on this story include:\n\n1\\. Adding illustrated animations to a photograph.\n\n2\\. Animating text.\n\n3\\. Creating animated graphics.\n\nScrap: https://www.instagram.com/p/CV\\_Ez\\_5MCFW/\n\nThis is an example of an artist who does very simple animations. They are using the relatively new Fresco function here, but I think it would be instructive to invite them to create a work with the Tween function.\n\nPossible HVAs:\n\n—A giveaway of a PSD file of a completed artwork\n\n—A library of symbols and small drawings to use in your own animated photo post",

However, we believe that we can inspire users to learn multiple flagships with relevant content that highlights ease of use and creation efficiency between products. We want to promote cross-product workflows between Photoshop and Illustrator, because these are commonly paired products with a large audience opportunity: approximately 500k Ps users do not use Ai.\n\nThe goal of this campaign is driving cross-product workflows between Illustrator and Photoshop.",

    "objective": "We’re targeting graphic designers to encourage and inspire cross-application workflows between Photoshop & Illustrator.\n\nSurveys and research shows that more people appreciate nature now than before the pandemic. Our paid members have been using our products professionally and feel glued to their desk, since the lockdown in March ’20. Moreover, many people struggle with isolation, anxiety, and are looking for distractions or ways to engage with people. In 2021, vaccines are rolling out and people have begun venturing outside. We expect summer seasonality to increase outdoor activities among our paid member base, and drive people to capture memories via photos.\n\nMore than 80% of our paid members use product for personal use cases and we expect them to venture out, we want to provide creative opportunities to use both Photoshop and Illustrator in their personal life and outside of their home. Although many of these users are non-beginners, we want the content to not only be inspirational but also accessible to all user skill levels.\n\nMinimal Landscape Portraits\n\n- have experienced a recent resurgence on Google SEO trends;\n- can be used for personal or professional use cases;\n- in nature, are a relevant fit in terms of summer seasonality and pandemic zeitgeist.\n- Illustration Graphics are top use case among Graphic Designers, Illustrators and Artists",
    "overview": "Paid members who use multiple apps get more value from their membership. These users have higher net promoter scores and retention rates. Most of our paid members buy the All Apps plan with the understanding that our products work well together and that they will be able to create anything by using products in the Creative Cloud Suite.\n\nMany users choose not to learn a new product because of the steep learning curve associated with each of our flagship products. However, we believe that we can inspire users to learn multiple flagships with relevant content that highlights ease of use and creation efficiency between products. We want to promote cross-product workflows between Photoshop and Illustrator, because these are commonly paired products with a large audience opportunity: approximately 500k Ps users do not use Ai.\n\nIn 2021, we’re seeing a few key design trends that we want to emphasize as we transition out of the pandemic and into the summer: (1) Environment, Nature, and Real-World References and (2) Socially conscious design.\n\nFor this campaign, we want to focus on the creation of minimal portraits with an emphasis on Nature. 1-minute tutorials have been highly effective to demonstrate app functionality and value.",

Article will include tips on how to use a clipping mask and how to reposition a photo or image to showcase its best parts. The idea that should come across is that you don't have to be a pro photographer or spend a lot on shoots, with clipping masks, you can focus on a part of an image to highlight your brand or aesthetic in an artistic or engaging way.",

    "objective": "Reach E&R Audiences:\n\nThey’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential. While close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\n\nThey’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\n\nWhile they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\n\nAs such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\nHow to Reach the E&R Audience:\n\nShow them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\n\nIf they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\n\nWhat we want the E&R Audience to Feel:\n\n- We want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\n- Provide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\n- That feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\n- We’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\n- And ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment",
    "overview": "A full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Combine & Organize: Acrobat makes it easy to combine and organize documents from multiple sources into a single PDF for a consolidated document solution that can be easily shared and accessed across surfaces.\n\nMessage # 2/ e-Signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

    "overview": "For this chapter of Everyone Can we are trying something new with the traditional Creator Series. Rather than building out a full campaign with a creative pro, we are working with a Savvy Communicator. This will help align and inspire our primary audience of Savvy Communicators with their teacher and realize this is for me. \n\nWe have multiple landing page experiences to understand how the traditional set up with hero landing page/video and full detailed tutorial videos compares to the lighter lift version of the tutorial pages that will include UGC video and a more static tutorial experience. This landing page test within the Display channel will help us understand how the two different landing experiences will perform. CPSAU will be a key indicator if we can still be as effective with this lighter lift experience. ",

    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nQ4 will be focused on an “Accountant” use case where they need to get an agreement over to their client quickly as they’re ready and available to sign. The TOFU assets bring this use case to life through a relatable, human situation where the Accountant quickly springs into action to get what they need to done for their new client/work, as well as handle what they need to with their anxious puppy.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. As an example, in the Puppy’s Gotta Go story you quickly see the accountant use multiple tools (Webforms; Edit; Request e-signature) to get what’s needed done. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Webforms: Acrobat makes it easy to collect information and apply that data to an existing templated project proposal to make onboarding a new client simple and easy.\n\nMessage # 2/ Request e-signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

    "objective": "Monthly 1+ Launch, Monthly Average Use\n\nE&R Audiences:\n\nThey’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\nWhile close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\nThey’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\nWhile they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\nAs such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\nHow to Reach the E&R Audience:\n\nShow them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\nIf they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\nWhat we want the E&R Audience to Feel:\n\nWe want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\nProvide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\nThat feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\nWe’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\nAnd ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment\n",

To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Combine & Organize: Acrobat makes it easy to combine and organize documents from multiple sources into a single PDF for a consolidated document solution that can be easily shared and accessed across surfaces.\n\nMessage # 2/ e-Signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

The creative reflects insights from recent CCI All Apps research and best practices implemented from previous upsell campaign performance results -- e.g., visually bold, eye-catching, and showcase inspiring uses of multiple apps.\n\nThese new Upsell animated UNWRP campaign assets are a creative mashup of content from the FY'22 UNWRP creator campaign and animation style from the FY23 All Apps Explainer video. Studio used an animated style to create these assets to explore whether creator content could be effectively presented through animation rather than our traditional creator narrated style (e.g., would our customers view the animated content as equally compelling, authentic, credible, and relatable?).  The key difference between concepts V1 and V2 is that V2 includes an image and voiceover of the creator (Ashley Fouyelle of UNWRP) whereas V1 is just showing Ashley's workflow and project with background music and image of her.

    "objective": "Monthly 1+ Launch, Monthly Average Use\n\nE&R Audiences:\n\nThey’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\nWhile close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\nThey’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\nWhile they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\nAs such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\nHow to Reach the E&R Audience:\n\nShow them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\nIf they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\nWhat we want the E&R Audience to Feel:\n\nWe want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\nProvide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\nThat feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\nWe’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\nAnd ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment\n",

To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Combine & Organize: Acrobat makes it easy to combine and organize documents from multiple sources into a single PDF for a consolidated document solution that can be easily shared and accessed across surfaces.\n\nMessage # 2/ e-Signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

    "overview": "AUSTRALIAN VERSION\nFor conversion-focused All Apps Upsell performance media channels, we are developing branded assets with animated images (GIF) and video assets that reinforce the All Apps plan value and key messages to current Creative Cloud Individual subscribers. The creative reflects insights from recent CCI All Apps research and best practices implemented from previous upsell campaign performance results -- e.g., visually bold, eye-catching, and showcase inspiring uses of multiple apps.\n\nThese new Upsell animated UNWRP campaign assets are a creative mashup of content from the FY'22 UNWRP creator campaign and animation style from the FY23 All Apps Explainer video. Studio used an animated style to create these assets to explore whether creator content could be effectively presented through animation rather than our traditional creator narrated style (e.g., would our customers view the animated content as equally compelling, authentic, credible, and relatable?).  The key difference between concepts V1 and V2 is that V2 includes an image and voiceover of the creator (Ashley Fouyelle of UNWRP) whereas V1 is just showing Ashley's workflow and project with background music and image of her.

    "overview": "FRENCH VERSION\nFor conversion-focused All Apps ACQUISITION performance media channels, we are developing branded assets with animated images (GIF) and video assets that reinforce the All Apps plan value and key messages to current Creative Cloud Individual subscribers. The creative reflects insights from recent CCI All Apps research and best practices implemented from previous campaign performance results -- e.g., visually bold, eye-catching, and showcase inspiring uses of multiple apps.\n\nThese new ACQ animated UNWRP campaign assets are a creative mashup of content from the FY'22 UNWRP creator campaign and animation style from the FY23 All Apps Explainer video. Studio used an animated style to create these assets to explore whether creator content could be effectively presented through animation rather than our traditional creator narrated style (e.g., would our customers view the animated content as equally compelling, authentic, credible, and relatable?).  The key difference between concepts V1 and V2 is that V2 includes an image and voiceover of the creator (Ashley Fouyelle of UNWRP) whereas V1 is just showing Ashley's workflow and project with background music and image of her.

    "objective": "Monthly 1+ Launch, Monthly Average Use\n\nE&R Audiences:\n\nThey’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\nWhile close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\nThey’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\nWhile they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\nAs such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\nHow to Reach the E&R Audience:\n\nShow them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\nIf they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\nWhat we want the E&R Audience to Feel:\n\nWe want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\nProvide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\nThat feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\nWe’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\nAnd ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment\n",

    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Combine & Organize: Acrobat makes it easy to combine and organize documents from multiple sources into a single PDF for a consolidated document solution that can be easily shared and accessed across surfaces.\n\nMessage # 2/ e-Signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

    "objective": "Monthly 1+ Launch, Monthly Average Use\n\nE&R Audiences:\n\nThey’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\nWhile close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\nThey’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\nWhile they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\nAs such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\nHow to Reach the E&R Audience:\n\nShow them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\nIf they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\nWhat we want the E&R Audience to Feel:\n\nWe want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\nProvide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\nThat feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\nWe’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\nAnd ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment\n",
    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Combine & Organize: Acrobat makes it easy to combine and organize documents from multiple sources into a single PDF for a consolidated document solution that can be easily shared and accessed across surfaces.\n\nMessage # 2/ e-Signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

    "objective": "Monthly 1+ Launch, Monthly Average Use\n\nE&R Audiences:\n\nThey’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\nWhile close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\nThey’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\nWhile they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\nAs such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\nHow to Reach the E&R Audience:\n\nShow them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\nIf they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\nWhat we want the E&R Audience to Feel:\n\nWe want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\nProvide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\nThat feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\nWe’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\nAnd ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment\n",

    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Combine & Organize: Acrobat makes it easy to combine and organize documents from multiple sources into a single PDF for a consolidated document solution that can be easily shared and accessed across surfaces.\n\nMessage # 2/ e-Signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",

The creative reflects insights from recent CCI All Apps research and best practices implemented from previous campaign performance results -- e.g., visually bold, eye-catching, and showcase inspiring uses of multiple apps.  \n  \n  \nThese new ACQ animated UNWRP campaign assets are a creative mashup of content from the FY'22 UNWRP creator campaign and animation style from the FY23 All Apps Explainer video. Studio used an animated style to create these assets to explore whether creator content could be effectively presented through animation rather than our traditional creator narrated style (e.g., would our customers view the animated content as equally compelling, authentic, credible, and relatable?).  The key difference between concepts V1 and V2 is that V2 includes an image and voiceover of the creator (Ashley Fouyelle of UNWRP) whereas V1 is just showing Ashley's workflow and project with background music and image of her.

The creative reflects insights from recent CCI All Apps research and best practices implemented from previous upsell campaign performance results -- e.g., visually bold, eye-catching, and showcase inspiring uses of multiple apps.\n\nThese All Apps Explainer assets use a dynamic and aimated style to spotlight flagship apps and services within the All Apps plan.

    "overview": "Traditional Chinese Version: \nFor conversion-focused All Apps Upsell performance media channels, we refreshed the original All Apps Explainer assets launched in Q1'23 to include Firefly and Adobe Express. The assets include animated images (GIF) and video assets that reinforce the All Apps plan value and key messages to current Creative Cloud Individual and photography plan subscribers. The creative reflects insights from recent CCI All Apps research and best practices implemented from previous upsell campaign performance results -- e.g., visually bold, eye-catching, and showcase inspiring uses of multiple apps.\n\nThese All Apps Explainer assets use a dynamic and aimated style to spotlight flagship apps and services within the All Apps plan.

    "objective": "**E&R Audiences:**\n\n- They’re Acrobat customers but they likely aren’t using the tools to their full potential\n- While close to 70% of paid users leverage Desktop per month, only ~12% leverage mobile and ~6% web – big oppt to drive engagement with additional surfaces\n- They’re paying because they see the value in Acrobat for their document solutions – but because they’re so time and resource strapped, they likely haven’t taken the time to explore and use all the tools and features that are available to them\n  - While they might not be aware of a tool, they might not connect what use case that tool can unlock for them – which is why we want to show (via use) and not tell (via tool explanation)\n- As such, they may have a variety of programs they work with to accomplish an end goal that can be achieved with just Acrobat\n\n**How to Reach the E&R Audience:**\n\n- Show them that they already have a complete set of PDF and e-signature tools for any practically document challenge\n- If they’re able to use additional tools, they can make their lives much easier, accomplish tasks in way less time, cut down on the number of apps or manual processes they use and eventually get back what every working professional and small business owner truly needs: More time to do the things they want to do\n\n**What we want the E&R Audience to Feel:**\n\n- We want them to experience and feel an “wait, seriously I can do that with Acrobat?” moment\n- Provide them with yet another reason to use Acrobat where they might’ve been using another app/tool\n- That feeling of surprise and delight and even excitement of when they realize they had something all along and this is going to change the way they work for the good.\n  - We’ve also seen that when people realize how much Acrobat can do, they cancel additional subscriptions they’re already paying for (like docusign), which is our end goal\n- And ultimately, that they feel like they’re getting the value out of their Acrobat subscription . Most of our cancellers cite it’s too expensive which is code for “Not worth the $” so driving value is essential to make them feel like it’s a valuable investment",
    "overview": "Acrobat’s Got It\n\nA full funnel campaign dedicated to showing working professionals and microbiz audiences how Acrobat can make their work easier and give them the confidence to take on any document challenge – because Acrobat’s got it.\n\nThe job of these lower funnel assets for Try/Buy is to bring the audience down the customer journey. To do that, we must focus on the value of a specific tool they saw in the TOF use case and really bring home the value to get the audience into a trial or into the product. Now is our opportunity to reference these tools again and really focus each asset on the benefit of one tool.\n\nMessage #1/ Combine & Organize: Acrobat makes it easy to combine and organize documents from multiple sources into a single PDF for a consolidated document solution that can be easily shared and accessed across surfaces.\n\nMessage # 2/ e-Signatures: The ability to send out for e-signatures greatly expedites the approval process so they can get started right away. Plus, the client’s experience in receiving a professional-looking proposal, inclusive of all relevant documentation, and having the ability to provide an e-signature creates a strong value perspective for our target company.",
